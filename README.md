<h1 align="center" id="title">🚀 Full Stack Web App Deployment with Docker</h1>

This project is a complete full-stack web application, fully containerized using Docker. It includes a modern React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a PostgreSQL database. Everything is set up to work together seamlessly using Docker Compose, with Nginx Proxy Manager handling the routing so both the frontend and backend can run on the same domain or port.

Whether you're deploying locally or to a remote server, this setup aims to make full-stack app deployment simple and efficient.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The codebase is split into two main parts:

- **`frontend/`** – The React application (UI/UX)
- **`backend/`** – The FastAPI server, including PostgreSQL integration

Each part includes its own `README.md` with setup and development instructions specific to that piece.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To get up and running quickly, start by following the instructions in each section:

- 👉 [Frontend Setup](./frontend/README.md)
- 👉 [Backend Setup](./backend/README.md)

Once both are set up, you'll be able to run the entire stack with just a single Docker command.
