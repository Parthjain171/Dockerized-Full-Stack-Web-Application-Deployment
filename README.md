Welcome to the Full-Stack FastAPI and React Application deployment. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying a full stack web application using Docker containers and a reverse proxy. The application consists of a React frontend and a FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL as the database. Nginx Proxy Manager is used to serve both frontend and backend on the same port.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- **frontend**: Contains the ReactJS application.
- **backend**: Contains the FastAPI application and PostgreSQL database integration.

Each directory has its own README file with detailed instructions specific to that part of the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, please follow the instructions in the respective directories:

- [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md)
- [Backend README](./backend/README.md)
